# Python-Quiz-for-Summative-AE2

Now that I have created a repo I need to set up all the .py files I will need for this project to match with my figma design.

This includes

start_screen.py

Quiz_ui.py

ending_screen.py

I need somewhere to store my questions as I would like to seperate each individual element of my quiz code to make it more managable if changes are needed.
My message box alerts, testing, the quiz engine that keeps track of the scoreing, something to keep track of the results and one more file to bring everything together.

quiz_questions.py

messages.py

test.quiz.py

quiz_engine.py

results.py

quiz_app.py

for nine files in total.
